# Trading-Projects

This is a collection of all the systematic trading projects I have pursued through my entire career thus far. It contains code from my BlackRock/Caltech Research Fellowship, where I conducted independent research on pre-IPO signals for post-public stock performance and my Philippine National Bank internship, where I created trading algorithms for the FX desk and a swaps pricer for the interest rate derivatives desk. More projects are to come, so stay tuned!
