# Trading-Projects

This is a collection of all the systematic trading projects I have pursued through my entire career thus far. It currently contains code from my Philippine National Bank internship, where I created trading algorithms for the FX desk and a swaps pricer for the interest rate derivatives desk. More projects are to come, so stay tuned!
